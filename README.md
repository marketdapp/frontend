Summary
=======

[Live Arbitrum Sepolia Demo](https://marketdapp.github.io)

The platform enables users to trade ERC20 tokens on EVM-compatible chains, operating fully on-chain.  
With the adoption of L2 networks like Arbitrum, it's now possible to run entire websites on-chain.

This is a non-custodial platform â€” we do not hold any funds or tokens.  
Mediators involved in dispute resolution can only direct tokens to one of the trade participants.

Features
========

- Creation of buy or sell offers as smart contracts, listed by token, fiat currency, and payment method.
- Decentralized dispute mediation.
- Fully on-chain messaging.

Call to Action
==============

Our platform is still in development, and there's much more to achieve. Our current milestones are:

1. Professional design for the client-side React app.
2. Security audit for the smart contracts, with plans to publish them as open-source.
3. On-chain encryption for messaging.
4. Facilitating regulatory compliance (KYC) for traders, if requested.
